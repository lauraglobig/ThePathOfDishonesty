# ThePathOfDishonesty

In this repository we have saved all the material needed to reproduce the results of our project 'The path of dishonesty'. 

In the "(1)rawData" folder, we have saved the data of all 150 subjects who took part in our study. 

In the "(2)analysis" folder, we saved the ERPs of the 99 subjects analysed. All analyses were done with the software "Brain Vision Analyzer", "RAGU", "R", "LORETA". 

In the "(3)tools" folder, we saved the task with which we collected the behavioural data.
