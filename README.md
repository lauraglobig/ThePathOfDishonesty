# ThePathOfDishonesty

In this repository we have stored all the material needed to reproduce the results of our project 'The path of dishonesty'. 

The "Data" folder contains the behavioral data of all 150 subjects who took part in our study. As the size of the raw EEG data far exceeds the limit made available by GitHub, this data will only be made available on request.

The "Analysis" folder contains the ERPs of the 99 subjects further analysed. All analyses were done with the softwares "Brain Vision Analyzer", "RAGU", "R", and "LORETA". 

The "Tools" folder contains the eprime-code of the task with which we collected the behavioural data.
